> In this project, I have worked with React.js and some great packages to create this good-looking fully-responsive page ðŸŽ¯.  
> I've used the advantages of React.js to manipulate the DOM efficiently ðŸŽ¢.  
> I like working with the AOS (Animate on scroll) library, it is magical âœ¨.  
> I've enjoyed using Swiper.js, that makes us so powerful for building automatic sliders and more ðŸ’«.  
> Also working with bootstrap and it's sections (react-bootstrap, react-bootstrap-accordion) and pure-css animations were taken the project to the next level ðŸ’¥.
